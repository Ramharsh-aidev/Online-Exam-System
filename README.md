[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE) <!-- Replace with your actual license badge if you have one -->

## Description

This project is a comprehensive Online Exam System developed in Java to showcase Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and best practices. It's designed as a web-based system (though currently implemented as a console application for demonstration) that allows administrators to create and manage exams, and students to take them.

The system provides functionalities for:

*   **Exam Creation:** Administrators can set up exams with specific durations and question sets.
*   **Question Pools:** Management of large question pools for reusability across exams.
*   **Question Types:** Support for both objective (multiple-choice) and essay questions.
*   **Timed Exams:** Exam sessions with timers to simulate real exam conditions.
*   **Random Question Selection:** Option to randomly select questions from question pools.
*   **Automated Grading (Objective):** Automatic scoring of objective questions.
*   **Manual Grading (Essay):** Placeholder for manual grading of essay questions (in a real system, a grading interface would be needed).
*   **Result Analysis:** Viewing exam results and generating summaries.
*   **User Roles:** Differentiation between Admin and Student users with specific functionalities.

This project is primarily intended to demonstrate OOP concepts in a practical application and can serve as a foundation for a more feature-rich online examination platform.

## Features

*   **User Management:** Admin and Student user roles with distinct capabilities.
*   **Question Pool Management:** Create, manage, and add questions to question pools.
*   **Exam Management:** Create, publish, and manage exams with timed durations.
*   **Objective and Essay Questions:** Support for multiple-choice and free-text questions.
*   **Random Question Selection:** Exams can include a mix of specific and random questions.
*   **Exam Timer:**  Simulates exam time limits and automatic submission on timeout.
*   **Exam Sessions:** Tracks student exam attempts and progress.
*   **Result Generation:** Automatic scoring for objective questions and result summaries.
*   **Exam Summary Reports:** Generate reports with average scores, highest/lowest scores, etc.

## Getting Started

To run this project, you will need:

*   **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Ensure you have JDK 8 or later installed.
*   **A Text Editor or IDE:**  (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code)

**Steps to Run:**

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Ramharsh-aidev/Online-Exam-System.git
    cd onlineexamsystem
    ```
   
2.  **Navigate to the `src/main/java` directory:**
    ```bash
    cd src/main/java
    ```

3.  **Compile the Java Code:**
    ```bash
    javac com/example/onlineexamsystem/OnlineExamSystem.java
    ```
    This command should compile all the Java files in the project.

4.  **Run the Application:**
    ```bash
    java com.example.onlineexamsystem.OnlineExamSystem
    ```
    This will start the Online Exam System demonstration in your console. Follow the prompts and observe the output in the console.

## Usage

The `OnlineExamSystem.java` main class demonstrates a typical workflow:

1.  **Initialization:** The `ExamManagementSystem` is initialized.
2.  **User Creation:** An Admin user and two Student users are created.
3.  **Question Pool Creation:** An Admin creates a "General Knowledge Pool" and adds objective and essay questions.
4.  **Exam Creation:** An Admin creates a "General Knowledge Test", sets a duration, and associates it with the question pool. Specific questions are added, and random question count is configured.
5.  **Exam Publishing:** The Admin publishes the exam.
6.  **Student Exam Taking:**
    *   Student 1 and Student 2 start the exam.
    *   They answer some questions (simulated answers are provided in the code).
    *   They submit the exam (or time runs out).
7.  **Result Viewing and Summary:** The Admin views the exam results and generates a summary report.

Observe the console output to see the interactions and results.

## Project Structure

The project is structured to separate concerns and demonstrate OOP principles:

```
onlineexamsystem/
├── src/
│ └── main/
│ └── java/
│ └── com/
│ └── example/
│ └── onlineexamsystem/
│ ├── model/ # Data model classes (Entities)
│ │ ├── EssayQuestion.java
│ │ ├── Exam.java
│ │ ├── ExamResult.java
│ │ ├── ObjectiveQuestion.java
│ │ ├── Question.java
│ │ ├── QuestionPool.java
│ │ ├── Timer.java
│ ├── service/ # Business logic and services
│ │ ├── ExamManagementSystem.java
│ │ └── ExamSession.java
│ ├── user/ # User-related classes (Admin, Student)
│ │ ├── AdminUser.java
│ │ ├── StudentUser.java
| | └── User.java
│ └── OnlineExamSystem.java # Main application class
└── README.md
└── LICENSE (Optional)
```
*   **`model/`**: Contains classes representing the data entities of the system (e.g., `Exam`, `Question`, `User`).
*   **`service/`**: Contains classes that implement the core business logic and workflows (e.g., `ExamManagementSystem`, `ExamSession`).
*   **`user/`**: Contains classes specifically for user types (`AdminUser`, `StudentUser`), inheriting from the base `User` class.
*   **`OnlineExamSystem.java`**: The main class with the `main` method to run the demonstration.

## OOP Concepts Demonstrated

This project effectively demonstrates several key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts:

*   **Abstraction:** The abstract `User` and `Question` classes define common interfaces and properties, hiding implementation details in subclasses.
*   **Encapsulation:** Data is protected within classes (using `private` access modifiers) and accessed through controlled public methods (getters, setters, and methods with business logic).
*   **Inheritance:** `AdminUser` and `StudentUser` inherit from `User`, and `ObjectiveQuestion` and `EssayQuestion` inherit from `Question`, promoting code reusability and a clear class hierarchy.
*   **Polymorphism:** The `checkAnswer()` method is polymorphic, with different implementations in `ObjectiveQuestion` and `EssayQuestion` based on their specific question types.
*   **Association and Relationships:** Classes are related to each other (e.g., `AdminUser` creates `Exam`s, `StudentUser` takes `Exam`s), representing real-world relationships in the exam system.
*   **Composition/Aggregation:** `Exam` is composed of `Question`s and can be associated with a `QuestionPool`.
*   **Proper Naming Conventions:**  Classes, methods, and variables are named descriptively using PascalCase and camelCase, enhancing code readability.

## Further Improvements

This project can be expanded upon to create a more robust and feature-rich Online Exam System:

*   **Database Integration:** Persist data using a database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB) instead of in-memory lists.
*   **Web User Interface (UI):** Develop a web-based UI using frameworks like Spring MVC, React, or Angular for a user-friendly experience.
*   **Enhanced Security:** Implement robust authentication, authorization, and input validation.
*   **Manual Grading Interface:** Create an interface for administrators to manually grade essay questions and provide feedback.
*   **Detailed Reporting and Analytics:** Implement more comprehensive reporting features.
*   **Different Question Types:** Add support for more question types (True/False, Fill-in-the-blanks, etc.).
*   **Exam Scheduling and Notifications:** Add features for scheduling exams and sending reminders.
*   **Scalability and Performance Optimizations:** Design for handling a larger number of users and exams.
*   **Unit and Integration Tests:** Implement comprehensive testing using frameworks like JUnit.
